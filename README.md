# flfi-project
Final project for Formal Languages

## Idea
* Fighting Game
* If all the attacks are "Projectiles", I shouldn't need to fully animate a person
* So a fighting game with wizards
* Do hitboxes and vital systems *first*, so prioritize DFA
* If the fighting game portion doesn't work out, the DFA will still be there
* Use regex to analyze/predict combos
